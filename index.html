            <strong>Goal</strong><br> Design an app that allowed users to find dog-friendly, business-verified, locations using DogsOut.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Target Organization</strong><br> Design an app that allowed users to find dog-friendly, business-verified, locations using DogsOut.
            <br><br>
            <strong>How we came to proposed solution</strong><br> We added two key features that would make a difference for dog owners: 1) Displaying pet-friendly locations and businesses in the users' nearby surroundings (picked up by GPS or zip code) and 2) All pet information displayed for businesses was verified by the company.
            <br><br>
            <strong>How our solution solved the problem</strong><br> Users can confidently bring their dog with them to any pet-friendly locations without running the risk of being turned away due to inaccurate information or by being unaware of pet policies.

          <strong>Challenges we faced</strong><br> • Finding the best way for all team members to edit and save the Xd file without complications (the project was done remotely). <br> • Decide how to have business owners verify the pet information for their businesses. <br> • Decide if we wanted to include ads from restaurants and bars on the app, <i>ie: bring your pup and get 10% discount on all sliders during Happy Hour.</i>
          <br><br>
          <strong>Final results</strong><br>After we completed the user interviews, we found that 60% of our users wanted to bring their dog with them to do daily activities. Hence, the team and I decided to create an app that allowed users to quickly search where they could bring their pets in order to plan their day. User testers found DogsOut to be efficient and convenient.</i>
          <br><br>
          <strong>What I learned</strong><br>• Reading reviews of competitor apps is a great way of gathering useful information for research. <br> • Using a map-search style was the best design and most convenient way for users to use on the run.
